This is a simple bash script that takes a git repository url and clones it to a local repos directory. It will delete the .git directory. The purpose is to feed repos into a local search engine for code search.

## Usage

```
chmod +x clone

$ ./clone https://github.com/deedima3/treasures-les map,tanstack,superforms

```
